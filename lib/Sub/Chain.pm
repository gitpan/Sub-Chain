=head1 NAME

Sub::Chain - Chain subs together and call in succession

=head1 VERSION

version 0.010011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $chain = Sub::Chain->new();

	$chain->push(\&wash, ['cold']);
	$chain->push(\&dry,  [{tumble => 'low'}]);
	$chain->push(\&fold);

	my @clean_laundry = $chain->call(@clothes);

	# if only it were that easy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module aims to provide a simple interface for
chaining multiple subs (coderefs) together
and executing them one after the other in a single call.

It was specifically designed to be built dynamically
from a list of specifications provided at runtime
to filter data through the specified list of functions.

Also see L<Sub::Chain::Named>
which appends subs to the chain by name rather than coderef.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

	my $chain = Sub::Chain->new();
	my $chain = Sub::Chain->new( option => $value );
	my $chain = Sub::Chain->new({option => $value});

Constructor.
Takes a hash or hashref of arguments.

Accepts values as described in L<OPTIONS|/OPTIONS>
that will be used as defaults
for any sub that doesn't override them.

=head2 append

	$chain->append(\&sub, \@args, \%opts);

Append a sub to the chain.
The C<\@args> arrayref will be flattened and passed to the C<\&sub>
after any arguments to L</call>.

	sub sum { my $s = 0; $s += $_ for @_; $s; }

	$chain->append(\&sum, [3, 4]);

	$chain->call(1, 2);
	# returns 10
	# equivalent to: sum(1, 2, 3, 4)

If you don't want to send any additional arguments to the sub
an empty arrayref (C<[]>) can be used.

This method returns the object so that it can be chained for simplicity:

	$chain->append(\&sub, \@args)->append(\&sub2)->append(\&sub3, [], \%opts);

The C<\%opts> hashref can be any of the options described in L</OPTIONS>
to override the defaults on the object for this particular sub.

=head2 call

	$chain->call(@args);

Calls each method in the chain
with the supplied (and any predetermined) arguments
according to any predefined options.

=head2 coderef

	my $sub = $chain->coderef;
	$sub->(@args);

Wrap C<< $self->call >> in a closure.
This is used to overload the function dereference operator
so you can pretend the instance is a coderef: C<< $chain->(@args) >>

=head1 OPTIONS

These options can define how a sub should be handled.
Specified in the options hashref for L</append>
they apply to that particular sub.
Specified in the constructor they can set the default
for how to handle any sub that doesn't override the option.

=over 4

=item *

C<result>

What to do with the result;
Valid values are:

=over 4

=item *

C<replace> - replace the argument list with the return value of each sub

=item *

C<discard> - discard the return value of each sub

=back

The arguments to L</call> are passed to each sub in the chain.
When C<replace> is specified the return value of one sub
is the argument list to the next.
This is useful, for instance, when chaining a number of
data cleaning or transformation functions together:

	sub add_uc { $_[0] . ' ' . uc $_[0]  }
	sub repeat { $_[0] x $_[1] }

	$chain->append(\&add_uc)->append(\&repeat, [2]);
	$chain->call('hi');

	# returns 'hi Hihi HI', similar to:

	my $s = 'hi';
	$s = add_uc($s);
	$s = repeat($s, 2);

When C<discard> is specified, the same arguments are sent to each sub.
This is useful when chaining subs that are called for their side effects
and you aren't interested in the return values.

	# assume database handle has RaiseError set
	$chain
		->append(\&log)
		->append(\&save_to_database)
		->append(\&email_to_user);

	# call in void context because we don't care about the return value
	$chain->call($object);

The default is C<replace> since that (arguably) makes this module more useful.

=item *

C<on_undef>

What to do when a value is undefined;
Valid values are:

=over 4

=item *

C<proceed> - proceed as normal (as if it was defined)

=item *

C<skip> - skip (don't call) the sub

=item *

C<blank> - initialize the value to a blank string

=back

The default is C<proceed>.

=head1 RATIONALE

This module started out as C<Data::Transform::Named>,
a named wrapper (like C<Sub::Chain::Named>) around
L<Data::Transform> (and specifically L<Data::Transform::Map>).

As the module was nearly finished I realized I was using very little
of L<Data::Transform> (and its documentation suggested that
I probably wouldn't want to use the only part that I I<was> using).
I also found that the output was not always what I expected.
I decided that it seemed reasonable according to the likely purpose
of L<Data::Transform>, and this module simply needed to be different.

So I attempted to think more abstractly
and realized that the essence of the module was not tied to
data transformation, but merely the succession of simple subroutine calls.

I then found and considered L<Sub::Pipeline>
but needed to be able to use the same
named subroutine with different arguments in a single chain,
so it seemed easier to me to stick with the code I had written
and just rename it and abstract it a bit further.

I also looked into L<Rule::Engine> which was beginning development
at the time I was searching.
However, like L<Data::Transform>, it seemed more complex than what I needed.
When I saw that L<Rule::Engine> was using [the very excellent] L<Moose>
I decided to pass since I was doing work on a number of very old machines
with old distros and old perls and constrained resources.
Again, it just seemed to be much more than what I was looking for.
